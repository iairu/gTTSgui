# Simple gTTS GUI

Are you struggling to find a high-quality free TTS online? Frustrated that the best quick TTS is only available through Google Translate? Want to save the TTS output for later use?

This simple GUI is here to help! It provides a large text area for input and a single button to save the output, making it easy and convenient to use.

The GUI is built using tkinter, ensuring a lightweight and responsive experience.
