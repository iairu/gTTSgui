## Simple gTTS GUI

# Currently broken because of google apis and outdated libs

Can't find a reasonably-good free TTS online? Annoyed that the only good quick TTS is an indirect part of Google Translate? Want to save the TTS output, so that you can play it whenever?

This simple GUI solves your problems by simply offering a giant text area and a single button to save the output.

GUI built using tkinter.

Currently no plans to expand this project.
